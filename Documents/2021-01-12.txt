1)learn how to javascript code run executed.
 -javascript code->parser(check all rules and validation)->convert to machine code->code run

2)Execution context and Execution stack:
 -which variable or function in global that all are global context.(not in a function.)

3)Execution context object:Variable Object(VO),Scope chain,"This" keyword

4)Two phase :
   1)Creation Phase:
	A)Creation of Variable Object
	B)Creation of Scope Chain
	C)Determin value of "this" keyword
   2)Execution Phase:
	-run code line by line
5)Hoisting:
 -each function ,a property is created in the Variable Object,pointing to function.
 -each variable ,a property is created in the Variable Object,and set to undefined.
 -note:That is load at initial phase and assign value at time of execution.

6)hoisting only work for function declaration not for function expression

7)Scope chain:
  -Each new function creates a scope
  -Lexical scoping:get access to the scope of outer function.
Note:Scope chain and execution stack works different.

8)"this" keyword:
  - point to global object 
  - this variable point to the object that is calling a method
9)objects and properties:
 -declare and access properties
10)Objects and methods
11)Loops and iteration:
  -loops:for,while
  -break,continue statement
  -challenge for disply reverse array using for loop

12)understand ES5(basic fundamentals(preffered)) and ES6 version(go to advance level)
