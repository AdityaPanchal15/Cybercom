Advanced Javascript:Objects and functions

1)Everything is an object:Inheritance and prototype chain
-here constructor instead of class
-Inheritance
-JS is prptotype based language
-every Javascript object has a prototype property,which makes inheritance possible in javascript.
-The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects to inherit.
-The constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype of the constructor itself,it's the prototype of ALL instances that are created through it;
-When a certain method is called,the search stars in the object itself,and if it cannot be found,the search moves on to the object's prototype.
This continues until the method is found:prototype chain.

2)creating objects:Function Constructors
-it has hasOwnProperty(),instanceof().

3)Objet.create()
-efficient than function costructor

4)Primitives Vs Objects:
-primitive will unchage and object property value change when pass in function.

5)Function:
-passing function as argument in function
-callback function(for more reusability)

6)Note:Every time check object instead of directly null check in if condition.
Ex.// var A={
//     name:'Aditya',
//     dept:null
// };


var A=null;                     //if A is null when access json then it will generate error for "if(A.dep)" 

if(A && A.dept){                //keep habit to check A also instead of
    console.log(A);
}

if(A.dept){                     //don't do   
    console.log(A);
}
