1)Function returning Function:
-It return function from function.So it is use anonymous function.

2)Immediately Invoked Function Expression:
-It is use for data privacy.We can not access variable from outside of IIFE.

3)Closures:
-An inner function has always access to the variable and parameters of its outer function,even after the outer function has returned.

4)Bind,call,Apply :
-Bind:it will bind function when we pass only one argument in place of 2,then after we can pass 2nd argument seperately.
-call:It will use where we can access property of 2nd object using fiest object name .We need to pass object in arguments.

5)New in ES6:
-Variable Declaration with let and const,Blocks and IIFEs,Strings,Arrow function,Destructing,Arrays,The Spread operator,Rest,Default Parameters,Maps,Classes and subclasses

6)variable declaration:let and const
-understand the difference between var,let and const.
-difference between block scope and function scope.
-let and const are block scope not a function scope.
-var is function scope.

7)String in ES6:
-access variable in string using ${var_name}in between `` instead of concatination (+) opearator in ''.
-learn new methods like repeat(),includes in string.

8)String Practice:
-slice:to cut array from specified index
-[] is use to du=ynamically add key in object.
ex.const dynamic = "model";
const item = {
  brand: "Porsche",
  [dynamic]: "Panamera"
}

console.log(item);
