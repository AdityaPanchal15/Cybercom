1)Binding function and constructir in class in ES6.
-It displays well structured code.
-constructor() method is use to define constructor in ES6.
-static keyword use with function.static function directly access using classname.
	Ex.class_name.function_name()
-In ES5,prototype and function constructor in differently display in code.

2)Inheritance in ES6:
-In ES5,we need to inherit super class in sub class means function constructor,we use call method with args.
-and also inherit prototype of parent class using subclass.prototype=Object.create(parent_class.prototype)

-In ES06,Easy to inharitance.
-use extends keyword to inherit property of parent class.
-super keyword use to pass args to parent class constructor.
-easily direct add additional prototype function in class.
