1)class,object,method and properties.
-class encapsulate method and properties.
-provide binding

2)override:
-use same function in parent class and child class it is override.

3)final keyword:
-use to prevent overriding in child class.

4)magic constants:
-__CLASS__ magic constant in order to get the class name
-__LINE__ to get the line number in which the constant is used.
-__FILE__ to get the full path or the filename in which the constant is used.
-__METHOD__ to get the name of the method in which the constant is used.

5)$this keyword:
-it is point to invoked object properties.

6)chaining method:
-we can implement chaining method by returning object from class method using $this keyword.
-ex.,$tank = $bmw -> fill(10) -> ride(40) -> tank;

7)abstract class and methods:
-An abstract class is a class that has at least one abstract method. 
-Abstract methods can only have names and arguments, and no other code. 
-can't instantiate.
-abstract keyword use for abstract class.

8)interface :
interface interfaceName { 
  // abstract methods
}
 
class Child implements interfaceName {
  // defines the interface methods and may have its own code
}

-interface contain only abstract method,constant and doesn't contain variables.
-implements multiple interface in one class.

9)Polymorphism:
-methods in different classes that do similar things should have the same name.

10)type hinting:
-With Type hinting we can specify the expected data type (arrays, objects, interface, etc.) for an argument in a function declaration.
