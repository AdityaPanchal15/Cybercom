Topic:Consuming HTTP services.

1)Do not initialization method in custructor.
if needed use ngOnInit(){}

2)seperation of concern:
-if there is any change then we need to change in different class files .
-use service between component and backend;
-so any changes we need to change at only one place. in service.  

3)service is use to communicate with backend.

4)Error handling:
-expected and unexpected error

-upexpected:low network,server offline
-expected:bad request,not found(404)

5)Handle error in service if there is 404 error or 400.
-use catch for getting error.
