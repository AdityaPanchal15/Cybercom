1.Build Services:


1)Authentication — user login and identity
2)Realtime Database — realtime, cloud hosted, NoSQL database
3)Cloud Firestore — realtime, cloud hosted, NoSQL database
4)Cloud Storage — massively scalable file storage
5)Cloud Functions — “serverless”, event driven backend
6)Firebase Hosting — global web hosting
7)ML Kit —SDK for common ML tasks

1)Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.

2)Realtime Database - Store and sync data with our NoSQL cloud database. Data is synced across all clients in realtime, and remains available when your app goes offline.

The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. When you build cross-platform apps with our iOS, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data.

3)Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Like Firebase Realtime Database, it keeps your data in sync across client apps through realtime listeners and offers offline support for mobile and web so you can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity. Cloud Firestore also offers seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud products, including Cloud Functions.

4)Cloud Storage for Firebase is built for app developers who need to store and serve user-generated content, such as photos or videos.

-Cloud Storage for Firebase is a powerful, simple, and cost-effective object storage service built for Google scale. The Firebase SDKs for Cloud Storage add Google security to file uploads and downloads for your Firebase apps, regardless of network quality.

5)Cloud Functions for Firebase is a serverless framework that lets you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. Your JavaScript or TypeScript code is stored in Google's cloud and runs in a managed environment. There's no need to manage and scale your own servers.

6)Firebase Hosting provides fast and secure hosting for your web app, static and dynamic content, and microservices.

-Firebase Hosting is production-grade web content hosting for developers. With a single command, you can quickly deploy web apps and serve both static and dynamic content to a global CDN (content delivery network). You can also pair Firebase Hosting with Cloud Functions or Cloud Run to build and host microservices on Firebase.

7)Firebase Machine Learning is a mobile SDK that brings Google's machine learning expertise to Android and iOS apps in a powerful yet easy-to-use package. Whether you're new or experienced in machine learning, you can implement the functionality you need in just a few lines of code. There's no need to have deep knowledge of neural networks or model optimization to get started. On the other hand, if you are an experienced ML developer, Firebase ML provides convenient APIs that help you use your custom TensorFlow Lite models in your mobile apps.



2.Release and monitor:

1)Firebase Crashlytics
-Get clear, actionable insight into app issues with this powerful crash reporting solution for iOS, Android, and Unity.
-Firebase Crashlytics is a lightweight, realtime crash reporter that helps you track, prioritize, and fix stability issues that erode your app quality.

2)Firebase Test Lab
-Test your app on devices hosted in a Google data center.
-Firebase Test Lab is a cloud-based app testing infrastructure that lets you test your app on a range of devices and configurations, so you can get a better idea of how it'll perform in the hands of live users.

3)Firebase Performance Monitoring
-Gain insight into your app's performance issues.
-Firebase Performance Monitoring is a service that helps you to gain insight into the performance characteristics of your iOS, Android, and web apps.
-You use the Performance Monitoring SDK to collect performance data from your app, then review and analyze that data in the Firebase console.



3.Engage:

1)Google Analytics
- Analytics reports help you understand clearly how your users behave, which enables you to make informed decisions regarding app marketing and performance optimizations.

2)Firebase Remote Config
-Change the behavior and appearance of your app without publishing an app update, at no cost, for unlimited daily active users.

3)Firebase Predictions
-Firebase Predictions applies machine learning to your analytics data to create dynamic user segments based on your users' predicted behavior. These predictions are automatically available for use with Firebase Remote Config, the Notifications composer, Firebase In-App Messaging, and A/B Testing. You can also export your app's Predictions data to BigQuery for further analysis or to push to third party tools.

4)Firebase A/B Testing
-Firebase A/B Testing helps you optimize your app experience by making it easy to run, analyze, and scale product and marketing experiments. 
-It gives you the power to test changes to your app’s UI, features, or engagement campaigns to see if they actually move the needle on your key metrics (like revenue and retention) before you roll them out widely.

5)Firebase Cloud Messaging
-Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send messages at no cost.
-Using FCM, you can notify a client app that new email or other data is available to sync. You can send notification messages to drive user re-engagement and retention.

6)Firebase In-App Messaging
-Firebase In-App Messaging helps you engage your app's active users by sending them targeted, contextual messages that encourage them to use key app features. 
-For example, 
	you could send an in-app message to get users to subscribe, 
	watch a video, 
	complete a level, 
	or buy an item.

7)Firebase Dynamic Links
-Firebase Dynamic Links are links that work the way you want, on multiple platforms, and whether or not your app is already installed.

-With Dynamic Links, your users get the best available experience for the platform they open your link on. If a user opens a Dynamic Link on iOS or Android, they can be taken directly to the linked content in your native app. If a user opens the same Dynamic Link in a desktop browser, they can be taken to the equivalent content on your website.

8)AdMob and Firebase
-Google AdMob is an easy way to monetize mobile apps with targeted, in-app advertising.
-Google AdMob is a mobile advertising platform that you can use to generate revenue from your app.
