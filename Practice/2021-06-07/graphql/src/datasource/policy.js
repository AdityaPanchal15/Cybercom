        <h3>Tips to Avoid a Return</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Prior to placing your order please make sure that the item you are ordering will fit through your door and in the space where it will go. If it doesn't the delivery company may have to leave the product right outside your door, on a porch or in a garage.</li>
        <li>If your item arrives with minor or cosmetic damages due to shipping, don't worry. We can attempt to replace the damaged parts on the product so you can avoid returning it.</li>

        <p>To make sure you receive your order as quick as possible we process all orders the moment they come in, for this reason orders may only be canceled within 24 hours of placement without incurring any fees.</p>
        <ol class="cancellation-policy">
        <li>Orders cancelled after 24 hours may be subject to a 15% restocking fee plus a return shipping fee at an estimated $1.75 per pound.</li>
        <li>If you cancel, return, or exchange only part of an order that included a package discount, you will forfeit your package discount and be credited less the amount of the discount.</li>
        <li>If there are backordered products on your order and you choose to wait for the backordered products to become available, we will make payment to the manufacturer to ensure that the products are reserved for you when they become available and not sold to anyone else. Your order will be considered a "special order" and therefore cannot be cancelled.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To cancel an order please <a href="http://192.168.0.60/aditya/index.php/bullhorn/cms_wysiwyg/directive/___directive/e3tzdG9yZSBkaXJlY3RfdXJsPSJjb250YWN0LXVzIn19/key/f396b28917b8100ecc8d3761da3f835a/">contact us</a>. Once cancelled your order status will change to cancelled and a cancellation confirmation email will be sent. Please keep this email as confirmation that you have cancelled your order. If you do not have a cancellation confirmation email or your order status in your customer portal does not say cancelled, your order was not cancelled.</p>

        <p>We work closely with our vendors and strive to be 100% certain of all product colors, dimensions, and measurements. Notwithstanding however, specifications on our site may not reflect accurately as the manufacturer can change the specs at any time without notice. In terms of color, images of certain items may look different than the actual item. This can occur for a variety of reasons including but not limited to the lighting during a photo shoot or your monitor&rsquo;s display. We have made every effort to display our products as accurately and will continue to do so. Any questions related to color, dimensions or specifications must be discussed prior to placing your order. If not fully addressed, 1StopBedrooms will not be held responsible. If there are things you are unclear about or have any questions, be sure to ask one of our representatives for assistance. Do not hesitate to call us! We are here to help every step of the way.</p>
